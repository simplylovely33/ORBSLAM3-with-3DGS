# ORB-SLAM3 with 3D Gaussian Splatting
This is a project that combines ORB-SLAM3 and 3D Guassian Splatting for real-time camera pose estimation and map reconstruction

# Prerequisites
Camera selection is Intel Realsense D435, we have implemented the project with **ROS noetic** on **Ubuntu 20.04**.

# Update Log
2026.6.11 

We use the Intel Realsense D435 as the capturing device, and use the `ROS Camera Calibration` package to calibrate the camera.
```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-usb-cam      ### Usb cam package installation
sudo apt install ros-noetic-camera-calibration      ### Calibration package installation
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch      ### Open the camera from /usb_cam/image_raw
rosrun camera_calibration cameracalibrator.py --size H*V --square S image:=/usb_cam/image_raw      ### Calibrate the camera with corresponding setting
```
`H,V` in `--size` indicate the number of horizontal and vertical inner corners respectively. `S` in `--square` indicate the size of each square on the checkboard, in meters. After you click the SAVE button in the display window, the calibration data is saved in '/tmp/calibrationdata.tar.gz'

2026.6.12
We use the `roslaunch` to read the rgb and depth images from the camera.
```
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch      ### Launch file to open the camera reading node.
```
But there is still an error occur when open the current frame and ORB-SLAM3 Map Viewer window. Try to use the `gdb` command to debug.
```
gdb /Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM3/RGBD      ### Getting into the debug mode
(gdb) run Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM3/MyD435.yaml /camera/rgb/image_raw:=/camera/color/image_raw /camera/depth_registered/image_raw:=/camera/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw      ### Configuration Setting
```
`LEFT:=RIGHT`ï¼Œ left indicate the name of subscribe topic and right express the input topic. 

2026.6.13
We change the chain of think thread to begin with ORB-SLAM2 instead of beginning with ORB-SLAM3(because there is clear open-source tutorial)
